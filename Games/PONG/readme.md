HOW TO RUN:


For Windows: ( I have two choices ) 
1. I have already compiled; simply download and execute 
2. If you're interested, I also have Python code for Windows.

For Linux, simply run using python3!

` python3 PONG.py `

For MacOS 
Similarly to Linux, MacOS ( Just minor change if you wana look at code)

` python3 PONG_MAC.py `
